# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for a security problem.** A public report tells
everyone who runs this framework about the hole at the same moment it tells us.

Report it privately, either way:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** — [open a private report](https://github.com/semitexa/semitexa-workflow/security/advisories/new).
  This keeps the discussion, the fix and the eventual advisory in one place, and
  nothing is visible until we publish it.
- **Email** — `support@semitexa.com`. Put "security" and the package name
  (`semitexa/workflow`) in the subject.

Include whatever you have: the version you are on, what you did, and what
happened. A minimal reproduction is worth more than a long description, but send
the description if that is what you have — an unclear report is better than a
report nobody sends.

## What to expect

This framework is maintained by a small team, so these are commitments we can
actually keep rather than the numbers that look best:

| | |
|---|---|
| We acknowledge your report | within 3 working days |
| We tell you whether we can reproduce it | within 7 working days |
| We agree a disclosure date with you | before anything is published |

If a report turns out not to be a vulnerability we will say so plainly, and say
why. If it is one, you will be credited in the advisory unless you ask not to
be.

## Which versions get a fix

Releases are date-based (`YYYY.MM.DD.HHMM`) and cut from `master`, often several
times a week. **Only the latest release is supported.** There are no maintenance
branches for older versions, and there is no long-term-support line: a fix ships
in the next release, and upgrading is how you get it.

`semitexa/ultimate` pins every internal `semitexa/*` package to an exact version,
so a consumer who installs through it moves the whole framework together rather
than one package at a time.

## Scope

In scope: anything in `semitexa/workflow` that lets a request, a job or a message do
something the application did not authorise, or read or change data it should
not — including data belonging to another user or tenant.

Out of scope, and said explicitly so nobody spends an evening on it:

- findings that require an attacker who already has code execution on the host,
  or access to `.env`;
- the `dev-*` branches; report against a released version;
- anything reachable only from `semitexa/dev`, which is a development-time
  package and is not meant to be installed in production;
- denial of service through resource exhaustion by a client we already
  authorised, unless it costs disproportionately little to cause.
